# Leagueback

> Quantify your personal impact in every League of Legends match.

Leagueback crunches in-game statistics to tell you—clearly and objectively—whether you carried, inted, or did everything humanly possible. Stop staring at raw KDA; start understanding your real contribution.

## How It Works

In Solo Queue roughly **40 % of matches** are effectively predetermined, while only **20 %** hinge on your individual performance. Leagueback analyses each game and classifies it into one of four outcomes:

| Outcome          | Meaning                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Impact Win       | Your play tipped the scales and secured the victory.        |
| Guaranteed Win   | Your team would have won with or without you.               |
| Impact Loss      | Your mistakes directly cost your team the game.            |
| Guaranteed Loss  | Even Faker couldn't have saved this one.                    |

The app surfaces these insights through clean charts and dashboards so you can focus your practice where it matters most.
